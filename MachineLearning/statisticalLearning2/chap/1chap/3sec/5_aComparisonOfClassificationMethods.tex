\paragraph{Logistic regression, LDA, QDA and KNN}
\subparagraph{Logistic regression VS LDA}
The only difference between the 2 approaches lies in fact that 
\sB{$\beta_{0}\text{ and }\beta_{1}$ are estimated using maximum 
likelihood, whereas $c_{0}\text{ and }c_{1}$ are computed using the
estimated mean and variance from a normal distribution}.\\
For $p=1~predictor$ we have :
\begin{align*}
	ln\left(\dfrac{p_{1}(x)}{1-p_{1}(x)}\right) &= c_{0} + c_{1}x\text{ LDA}\\
	ln\left(\dfrac{p_{1}(x)}{1-p_{1}(x)}\right) &= \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}x\text{ Logistic regression}\\
\end{align*}
\tB{It is generally felt that logistic regression is a safer, more robust bet than the LDA model,
relying on fewer assumptions.}

\subparagraph{KNN}
KNN is a completely non-parametric approach: no assumptions are made
about the shape of the decision boundary. Therefore, \sB{we can expect this
approach to dominate LDA and Logistic regression when th decision 
boundary is highly non-linear}.

\subparagraph{QDA}
\tB{It is a compromise between the non-parametric KNN method and the 
linear LDA and Logistic regression approaches.}
