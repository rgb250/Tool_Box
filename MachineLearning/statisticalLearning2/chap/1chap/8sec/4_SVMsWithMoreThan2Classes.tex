\paragraph{One-Versus-One Classification}
Suppose that we would like to perform classification using SVMs, and
there are $K>2$ classes.\\
We classify a test observation using each of the $\binom{K}{2}$ 
classifier and we tally the number of times that the test observation
is assigned to each of the $K$ classes. The final classification is 
performed by assigning the test observation to the class to which it
was most frequently assigned in these $\binom{K}{2}$ pairwise
classifications.

\paragraph{One-Versus-All Classification}
We fit $K$ SVMs, each time comparing one of the $K$ classes to the 
remaining $K-1$ classes.
