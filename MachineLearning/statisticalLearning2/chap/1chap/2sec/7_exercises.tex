 	\item The null hypothesis corresponding to p-values of the 
		TABLE 3.4 is\\\emph{$H_{0}:\beta_{TV}=\beta_{radio}=
		\beta_{newspaper}=0$}.\\Newspaper contribution is 
		staticaly few sigificant in comparison with radio and
		TV.
	\item \emph{KNN classifier}: given a test observation $x_{0}$
		it identifies the K point in the training data that are
		closet to $x_{0}$ represented by $\mathcal{N}_{0}$.
		And then the conditional probability for class $j$ as
		the fraction of points in $\mathcal{N}_{0}$ whose
		response values equal $j$.\\\emph{KNN regression}:
		it estimates $f\left(x_{0}\right)$ using average of all
		the training responses in $\mathcal{N}_{0}$.\\Therefore
		\emph{KNN classifier} make a prediction on the class 
		$j$ of $x_{0}$, whereas \emph{KNN regression} make 
		prediction on the value on $f\left(x_{0}\right)$.

			\item[(b)] Salary prediction for a female with
				$IQ=110$ and $GPA=4.0$:\\
				$salary=50+20\times 4.0+0.07\times 110
				+35+0.01\times(110\times4.0)-10\times
				(4.0\times 1)=137.1$
			\item[(c)] We should rather observe the p-value
				for the GPA/IQ interaction term and
				after that decide if despite the low
				value of this estimate we can ignore
				this interaction effect.

	\item 
		\begin{itemize}	
			\item[(a)] Knowing that the true relationship 
				between $X$ and $Y$ is linear, cubic 
				regression will have a unsuitable curve
				, because the real form of the data is
				a straight line.\\Thus the training RSS
				from cubic regression will be greater
				than this of simple regression.
			\item[(b)] The response remains the same.
			\item[(c)] This time we would expect that the
				training RSS from cubic regression
				have a lower value than that of linear
				regression.
			\item[(d)] The response remains the same.
