Let $\omega_{m}$ with $m\in\inter{1}{M}$ be unit \emph{p}-vectors of unknown parameters.
The projection pursuit regression (PPR):
$$ f(X) = \su{{m=1}}{M}g_{m}(\omega_{m}^{T}X)$$
This is an additive model, bu in the derived features $V_{m}=\omega_{m}^{T}X$ rather than the
inputs themeselves.
The functions $g_{m}$ are unspecified an are estimated along with the directions $\omega_{m}$
using some flexible smoothing method. The function $g_{m}(\omega_{m}^{T}X)$ is called a ridge
function in $\mathbb{R}^{p}$
The scalar variable $V_{m}=\omega_{m}X$ is the projection of $X$ onto the unit vector $\omega_{m}$
an we seek $\omega_{m}$ so that the model fits well, hence the name ``projection pursuit''.
