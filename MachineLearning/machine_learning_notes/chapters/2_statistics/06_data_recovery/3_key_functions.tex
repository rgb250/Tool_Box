\subsection{Softmax function}
\paragraph{Purpose}
The softmax function takes as input a vector $z$ of $K$ real numbers, 
and normalizes it into a probability distribution consisting of $K$ 
probabilities proportional to the exponentials of the input numbers.
\begin{center}
    $\sigma(\bm{z})_{i} = \dfrac{e^{z_{i}}}{\su{j=1}{K}e^{z_{j}}}$
\end{center}
\paragraph{Interpretation}
it is rather a smooth approximation of the \emph{argmax} function, 
meaning the function returning the index of the maximum value of a given
vector.
