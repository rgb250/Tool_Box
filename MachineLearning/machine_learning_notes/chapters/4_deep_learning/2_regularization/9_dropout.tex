\subsection{Drop out}
\paragraph{Purpose}
It provides an inexpensive approximation to \tB{training and evaluating a \emph{bagged
ensemble} of exponentially many neural networks}.

\paragraph{Theory}
It \uB{trains the ensemble consisting of \textbf{all sub-networks that can be formed by
removing non-output units}} from an underlying base network.
