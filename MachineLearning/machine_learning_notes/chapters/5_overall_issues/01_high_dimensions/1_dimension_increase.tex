\subsection{Curse of dimensionality}
\paragraph{Purpose}
When the dimensionality increases, the \tB{volume of the space increases so fast that the available 
data become sparse}.
\paragraph{Main issues}
\subparagraph{Combinatorics}
Let's consider $(d,k)\in\mathbb{N}^{*}$ and $(x_{i})_{1\leq i\leq d} \in\inter{1}{K}^{d}$, the
range of possible values for the families $(x_{i})_{1\leq i\leq d}$ is $K^{d}$  which increases 
obviously exponentially.
