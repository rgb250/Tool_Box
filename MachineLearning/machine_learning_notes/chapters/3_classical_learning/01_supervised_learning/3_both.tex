\subsection{Mixture models}
\paragraph{Purpose}
It is the simplest form of \emph{Latent Variable Models (LVMs)} is when $z_{i}\in
\{k\}_{1\leq k\leq K}$. 2 mains application of mixture models:
\begin{itemize}
    \item use them as \emph{black-box} density model, $p(\bm{x}_{i})$, useful for data
        compression, outlier detection and creating generative classifiers
    \item use for clustering
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Assumptions}
\paragraph{Theory}
We use a discrete prior $p(z_{i}) = \text{\emph{Cat}}(\bm{\ conda install -c conda-forge juliapi})$ and the likelihood
$p(\bm{x}_{i}|z_{i} = k)$, finally the \textbf{mixture model} is :
\begin{center}
    $\prob{\bm{x}_{i}|\bm{\theta}} = \su{k=1}{K}\pi_{k}\prob{\bm{x}_{i}|z_{i}=k,
    \bm{\theta}} = \su{k=1}{K}\pi_{k}\mathbb{P}_{k}\left(\bm{x}_{i}|\bm{\theta}\right)$
\end{center}
where $\mathbb{P}_{k}$ is the $k$'th \emph{base distribution}.
\subparagraph{Mixtures of Gaussian}
Each base distribution in the mixture is a multivariate Gaussian with mean $\mu_{k}$ 
and covariance matrix $\bm{\Sigma}_{k}$:
$\prob{\bm{x}_{i}|\bm{\theta}}=\su{k=1}\pi_{k}\mathcal{N}\left(\bm{x}_{i}|\bm{\mu}_{k},
    \bm{\Sigma_{k}}\right)$\\
Given a sufficiently large number of mixture components a \tB{Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMMs) can be used to approximate any density defined on $\mathbb{R}^{D}$}.
\subparagraph{Mixtures of multinoullis}
can be used to define density models on data consisting of a \emph{D}-dimensional bit
vectors: $\prob{\bm{x}_{i}|z_{i}=k,\bm{\theta}} = \prd{j=1}{D}\text{\emph{Ber}}(x_{ij}|
\mu_{jk})=\prd{j=1}{D}\mu_{jk}^{x_{ij}}(1-\mu_{jk})^{1-x_{ij}}$\\
where $\mu_{jk}$ is the probability that bit $j$ turns on in cluster $k$.
\subparagraph{Mixture of experts}
are build from a discriminative perspective, they relies on the idea that a good
model different linear method each applying to a different part of the input space.\\
We can model this by allowing the mixing weights and the mixture densities to be
input-dependent: 
\begin{center}
    $\begin{cases}
        \prob{y_{i}|\bm{x}_{i},z_{i}=k,\bm{\theta}} = \mathcal{N}(y_{i}|\bm{w}_{k}^{T}
        \bm{x}_{i},\sigma_{k}^{2}) \\
        \prob{z_{i}|\bm{x}_{i},\bm{\theta}} = \text{\emph{Cat}}(z_{i}|S(\bm{V}^{T}
        \bm{x}_{i}))
    \end{cases}$
\end{center}
Useful in solving inverse problems, the ones in which we have to invert a many-to-one
mapping, for example in robotics where the location of the end effector (hand) $\bm{y}$
is uniquely determined by the joint angles of the motors, $\bm{x}$.

The overall posterior is then
\begin{center}
    \fr{$\prob{y_{i}|\bm{x}_{i},\bm{\theta}} = \su{k}{}\prob{z_{i}=k|\bm{x}_{i},z_{i}=k
    ,\bm{\theta}}$}
\end{center}




\paragraph{Strengths}

\paragraph{Weaknesses}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Use of a single latent variable to generate the observation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Support Vector Machines (SVMs)}
\paragraph{Purpose}
The \tB{combination of the \emph{kernel trick} plus a modified loss function 
allowing \emph{sparsity}}, meaning that the prediction will only depend on a
subset of the training data called \emph{support vectors}. The overall 
process is known as a \emph{Support Vector Machine}.\\
Because of sparsity encoding in the loss function instead of in the prior, 
kernel encoding through a trick instead of being an explicit part of the 
model,\tB{SVMs do not provide probabilistic outputs}.
\subparagraph{SVMs for regression}
with \emph{kernalized ridge regression} the solution $\bm{w}$ depends on all 
the training inputs. We should then use a variant of \emph{Huber loss} 
function: the \tB{\textit{epsilon insensitive loss function}}: 
\begin{center}
    \fr{$L_{\epsilon}\left(y-\hat{y}\right) = 
    \begin{cases}
        0 & \Leftarrow \lvert y-\hat{y}\rvert < \epsilon \\
        \lvert y-\hat{y}\rvert -\epsilon &\Leftarrow \lvert y-\hat{y}\rvert 
            \geq \epsilon    
    \end{cases}$}
\end{center}
meaning that any point lying inside an $\epsilon\text{-\textbf{tube}}$ a
around the prediction is not penalized: $J=C\su{i=1}{n}L_{\epsilon}\left(
y_{i} - \hat{y}_{i}\right) + \frac{1}{2}\norm{\bm{w}}^{2}$, with $C=\frac{1}{
\lambda}$ is a \emph{regularization constant}.\\
It can be shown that \tB{optimal solution has the form $\hat{\bm{w}} = \su{i}{
}\alpha_{i} \bm{x}_{i}$, where $\alpha_{i}\geq 0$}. It turns out that \tB{
$\bm{\alpha}$ is sparse as we don't care about errors which are smaller than 
$\epsilon$. The $\bm{x}_{i}$ for which $\alpha_{i}>0$ are the \textbf{support 
vectors}}.\\
Then we have $\hat{y}(\bm{x}) = \hat{w}_{0} + \hat{\bm{w}}\bm{x}  = \hat{w}_{0}
+ \su{i}{}\alpha_{i}\bm{x}_{i}^{T}\bm{x} = \su{i}{}\alpha_{i}k(\bm{x},\bm{x}_{i})$

\subparagraph{Classification}
we consider now the \emph{hinge loss}:
\begin{center}
    $L_{hinge}(y,\eta) = \max\left(0, 1-y\eta\right) = \left(1-y\eta\right)_{+}$
\end{center}
where $\eta=f(\bm{x})$ is our 'confidence' in choosing label $y=1$ however it does not
need to have any probabilistic semantics.\\
The overall objective has the form $\min_{\bm{w}:w_{0}}\frac{1}{2}\norm{\bm{w}}^{2} +
C\su{i=1}{n}\left(1-y_{i},f(\bm{x}_{i})\right)$. Same principle as in regression, but
this time \tB{$\hat{y}(\bm{x}) = sgn\left(f(\bm{x})\right) = sgn\left(\hat{w}_{0} +
\hat{\bm{w}}^{T}\bm{x}\right)= sgn\left(\hat{w}_{0} + \su{i=1}{n}\alpha_{i}k(\bm{x}_{i}
,\bm{x})\right)$}
