\subsection{Basics}
Suppose $p^{*}\left(\bm{x}\right)$ is our true but intractable distribution and $q(\bm{x})$
is some approximation chosen from some tractable family, such as a multivariate Gaussian.\\
In using:
\begin{center}
    \fr{$\mathbb{KL}\left(p^{*}||q\right)=\su{\bm{x}}{}q(\bm{x})\log\left(\dfrac{q(\bm{X})}{p^{*}(
    \bm{x})}\right)$}
\end{center}

\subparagraph{Mean field method}
We assume the posterior is fully factorized approximation of the form:
$q(\bm{x}) = \prd{i}{}q_{i}(\bm{x}_{i})$
The goal is to solve the optimization problem $\displaystyle\min \mathbb{KL}(q||p)$

\subsection{Variational Bayes}
When we want to infer the parameters themselves, if we make a fully factorized approximation
$\prob{\bm{\theta}|\mathcal{D}}\approx\prd{k}{}q(\bm{\theta}_{k})$
