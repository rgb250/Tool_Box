\paragraph{Regression function of $Y$ on $X$}
\begin{center}
	$\E{Y|\left\{ X=x \right\}}=\Su{ {-\infty}}{\infty}yh(y/x)dx$
\end{center}
The graph of this regression function of $Y$ on $X$ is known as the 
regression curve of $Y$ on $X$.
\paragraph{Linear regression}
Let X and Y be two random variables with joint probability density function
$f(x, y)$ and let $\E{Y |\left\{ X = x \right\}}$ be the regression function of Y
on X. If this regression function is linear, then $\E{Y |\left\{ X = x \right\}}$ is called a linear
regression of Y on X. Otherwise, it is called nonlinear regression of Y on X.
\paragraph{Scedastic function}
Let $h(y/x)$ is the conditional density of Y given $\left\{ X=x \right\}$
\begin{center}
	$\V{Y|\left\{ X=x \right\}}=\Su{ {-\infty}}{\infty}y^{2}h(y/x)dy$
\end{center}
The graph of this scedastic function of Y on X is known as the scedastic
curve of Y on X
