The random variables $X$ and $Y$ are (stochastically) independent if and only if
\begin{center}
	$\forall (x,y)\in R_{X}\times R_{Y}, f(x,y)=f_{1}(x)f_{2}(y)$
\end{center}

\paragraph{Conditionally independent}
Usually, in a set of variables, the unconditional independence is rare, because most 
variables can influence most variables, however the influence is mediated via other 
variables rather than being direct. We therefore say $X$ and $Y$ are conditionnally
independent given $Z$ if
\begin{center}
	$\probC{Z}{X} = \probC{Z}{X}\probC{Z}{Y}$\\
	or\\
	$f_{x,y}(x,y|z) = f_{x}(x|z)\times f_{y}(y|z)$
\end{center}
