\paragraph{Efficiency of estimators}
Let $\hat{\theta}_{1}$ and $\hat{\theta}_{2}$ be 2 unbiased estimators
of $\theta$.\\
$$\V{\hat{\theta}_{1}} < \V{\hat{\theta}_{2}} \Rightarrow 
\hat{\theta}_{1}\text{ is said to be more efficient than }\hat{\theta}_{2}$$ \\
The ratio is given by:
$$ \eta\left(\hat{\theta}_{1},\hat{\theta}_{2}\right)=\dfrac{\V{\hat{\theta}_{2}}}{\V{\hat{\theta}_{1}}}$$
is called relative efficiently of $\hat{\theta}_{1}$ with respect to 
$\hat{\theta}_{2}$.
