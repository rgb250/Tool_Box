\paragraph{The likelihood ratio test statistics}
For testing the simple null hypothesis $H_{0}:\theta\in\Sigma_{0}$ 
against the composite alternative hypothesis $H_{\alpha}\notin\Sigma_{0}$ based on a set of random sample data $\prth{x}{i}{1}{n}$ is defined
as $W\left(\prth{x}{i}{1}{n}\right) = \frac{\max_{{\theta\in\Omega_{0}}}L\left(\theta;\prth{x}{i}{1}{n}\right)}{\max_{\theta\in\Omega}L\left(\theta;\prth{x}{i}{1}{n}\right)}$ \\
Let $k\in[0,1]$ a likelihood ratio test is any test that has a critical
region $C$ that is rejection region) of the form:
$C=\left\{\prth{x}{i}{1}{n}|W\left(\prth{x}{i}{1}{n}\right)\leq k\right\}$
